### iOS Mobile Application Security Pentesting Study Plan<br>

iOS mobile application security pentesting involves assessing the security of iOS applications to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. This process helps ensure that applications are secure against potential threats and attacks. Starting iOS mobile application security pentesting can be daunting, but with a structured approach, you can build a solid foundation.  Here's a step-by-step roadmap to guide you through the process:

### 1. **Understand the Basics of iOS Development**
   - **Learn Swift**: The primary programming language for iOS. Familiarize yourself with Xcode, Apple's IDE.
     - Resources: [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/), [Apple’s Swift Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/).
   - **Study iOS Architecture**: Understand the iOS operating system, its architecture, and how iOS apps are structured.

### 2. **Get Familiar with Mobile Security Basics**
   - **Mobile Security Concepts**: Understand common mobile security issues and best practices.
     - Resources: [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-security-testing-guide/).

### 3. **Set Up Your Pentesting Environment**
   - **Mac System**: You’ll need a macOS system to run Xcode and other iOS-specific tools.
   - **Devices**: Have both jailbroken and non-jailbroken devices for comprehensive testing.

### 4. **Learn iOS App Penetration Testing Tools**
   - **Burp Suite**: For intercepting and analyzing network traffic.
   - **Frida**: Dynamic instrumentation toolkit for debugging and reverse engineering.
   - **Cycript**: Scripting tool that lets you run Objective-C code in the context of running apps.
   - **Objection**: Runtime mobile exploration toolkit powered by Frida.
   - **MobSF (Mobile Security Framework)**: For automated security analysis of mobile apps.

### 5. **Understand iOS Application Security Issues**
   - **OWASP Mobile Top 10**: Familiarize yourself with the common vulnerabilities.
   - **Learn about Common Attacks**: Insecure data storage, insecure communication, insecure authentication, etc.

### 6. **Hands-On Practice**
   - **Capture the Flag (CTF) Challenges**: Participate in mobile security CTFs.
     - Resources: [PentesterLab](https://pentesterlab.com/), [HackerOne CTF](https://www.hackerone.com/ctf).
   - **Vulnerable iOS Applications**: Practice on intentionally vulnerable applications.
     - Resources: [Damn Vulnerable iOS App (DVIA)](http://damnvulnerableiosapp.com/), [iGoat](https://github.com/OWASP/iGoat).

### 7. **Advanced Topics**
   - **Reverse Engineering**: Learn how to reverse engineer iOS apps using tools like Hopper and IDA Pro.
   - **Code Injection**: Understand how to inject code and manipulate app behavior.
   - **Binary Exploitation**: Study how to exploit binary vulnerabilities in iOS apps.

### 8. **Stay Updated**
   - **Follow Security Blogs**: Keep up with the latest trends and vulnerabilities in iOS security.
     - Resources: [Objective-See](https://objective-see.com/blog.html), [iOS AppSec](https://iosappsec.com/).
   - **Join Communities**: Participate in forums and groups dedicated to mobile security.
     - Resources: [Reddit r/iOSProgramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

Two critical areas in iOS application security are static vulnerability analysis and forensic vulnerabilities.

### Static Vulnerability Analysis

Static vulnerability analysis involves examining the application's code and resources without executing it. This method is essential for identifying security issues that are embedded in the code, such as insecure coding practices, hardcoded secrets, and more. Here are the key components of static vulnerability analysis:

1. **Source Code Review**:
   - **Insecure Coding Practices**: Identifying issues such as lack of input validation, improper error handling, and insecure data storage.
   - **Hardcoded Secrets**: Detecting hardcoded API keys, passwords, and other sensitive information within the code.

2. **Static Analysis Tools**:
   - **MobSF (Mobile Security Framework)**: An automated tool for static analysis of mobile apps.
   - **OWASP Mobile App Security Checks**: Ensuring compliance with OWASP's mobile security guidelines.

3. **Binary Analysis**:
   - **Decompiling and Disassembling**: Tools like Hopper and IDA Pro can be used to analyze the app’s binary for vulnerabilities.
   - **Code Obfuscation**: Checking if the code is obfuscated to protect against reverse engineering.

4. **Security Misconfigurations**:
   - **Plist Files**: Ensuring sensitive information is not stored in configuration files.
   - **Entitlements and Permissions**: Reviewing the app’s permissions and entitlements to ensure they are appropriately set.

### Forensic Vulnerabilities

Forensic vulnerabilities involve analyzing the application's behavior and data storage practices to identify issues that could be exploited by attackers or forensic investigators. This analysis is crucial for ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed unintentionally. Key components include:

1. **Data Storage Analysis**:
   - **Insecure Data Storage**: Checking if sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, personal information) is stored securely using iOS's data protection mechanisms.
   - **Keychain Analysis**: Ensuring that the keychain is used appropriately for storing sensitive data.

2. **Data Transmission**:
   - **Secure Communication**: Verifying that data transmitted over the network is encrypted using protocols like HTTPS.
   - **Network Sniffing**: Analyzing network traffic to ensure no sensitive information is transmitted in plaintext.

3. **Application Logs**:
   - **Log Review**: Ensuring that application logs do not contain sensitive information that could be accessed by an attacker.
   - **Log Management**: Implementing proper log management practices to prevent unauthorized access.

4. **File System Analysis**:
   - **Cache and Temporary Files**: Ensuring that sensitive information is not left in cache or temporary files that could be accessed by attackers.
   - **Forensic Tools**: Using forensic tools to simulate an attacker's behavior and identify potential data leaks.

5. **Jailbreak Detection**:
   - **Detection Mechanisms**: Ensuring the app can detect if the device is jailbroken and responds appropriately to mitigate security risks.


### Suggested Learning Path
1. **Month 1-2**: Basics of iOS Development and Mobile Security.
2. **Month 3-4**: Set up environment, learn tools, and basic pentesting techniques.
3. **Month 5-6**: Practice on CTFs and vulnerable applications.
4. **Month 7-8**: Advanced topics like reverse engineering and binary exploitation.
5. **Month 9-10**: Continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends.

By following this roadmap, you'll gradually build the skills needed for iOS mobile application security pentesting.
